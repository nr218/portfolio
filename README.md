# Data Science Portfolio

##[Django Web Dashboard to Visualize Employee Satisfaction](https://github.com/nr218/portfolio/tree/master/glassdoor_dashboard)

The purpose of this project is to:
1. Load data from the Glassdoor partner API, save it to Postgres SQL Database and perform data cleaning for data analysis to be conducted
2. Create a Django web dashboard with summaries and insights about the reviews using Dask for UI Analytics and Plotly for data visualization

Tools Used: Python (Numpy, Dask, Plotly), Luigi, Test Driven Development using Pytest, Pipenv, PostgreSQL, Django

##[Forecasting Bike Share Usage](https://github.com/nr218/portfolio/blob/master/Bike_Share_Usage.ipynb)

The purpose of this project is to:
1. Conduct data exploration and data visualization to analyze trends in the sales data
2. Build a multiple linear regression model to predict the hourly bike rental

Tools Used: Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn, Seaborn)

##[Cancer Classification from Gene Expression](https://github.com/nr218/portfolio/blob/master/Cancer_Classification.ipynb)

The purpose of this project is to:
1. Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to visualize the data and reduce its dimensions
2. Implement logistic regression to build a classification model to distinguish between two related classes of cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), using gene expression measurements

Tools Used: Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn, Seaborn)
